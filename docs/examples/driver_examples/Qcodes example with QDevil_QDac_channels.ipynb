    "  * v: DC voltage\n",
    "  * vrange: DC voltage range\n",
    "  * i: Current out (read-only)\n",
    "  * irange: Current measurement range\n",

    "  * sync_delay: Sync delay delay \n",
    "  * sync_duration: Sync duration\n",
    "  \n",
    "The slope is the (maximal) slope in V/s that the channel can allow its voltage to change by. By default, all channels have a slope of \"Inf\". The slope can be changed dynamically, but no more than 8 channels can have a finite slope at any given time (this is due to hardware limitations).\n",
