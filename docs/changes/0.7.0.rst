Breaking Changes:
_________________

* Deprecation warnings are no longer issued as ``DeprecationWarning``
  but as a new custom type ``QCoDeSDeprecationWarning`` that does inherit
  from ``RuntimeWarning``. The reason for this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` s
  are suppressed in the output by default.
* Changes to the YAML format specifying the Station. See The `Station notebook <../examples/Station.ipynb>`_.
  for examples of how the Station should be configured.

    * Specifying module name of a driver as driver and type is deprecated. Instead the full module path should
      be specified as type and the driver field removed. (#1753, #1760)
    * Specifying the limits of a parameter as a list of comma separated values is deprecated. Instead the limits
      should be specified as an array. (#1756)
