Added a new QCoDeS driver for the Cryomagnetics Model 4G superconducting magnet power supply.

The `CryomagneticsModel4G` driver provides an interface to control and communicate with the Cryomagnetics Model 4G
superconducting magnet power supply using the VISA protocol. It allows setting and reading the magnetic field, ramp rate,
and various other parameters of the instrument.

Key features of the driver include:

* Setting and reading the magnetic field in Tesla, considering the coil constant and current limits.

* Controlling the ramp rate in Tesla per minute.

* Checking the operating state of the magnet and handling quench conditions and power module failures.

* Blocking and non-blocking ramping of the magnetic field.

* Handling communication errors and retrying failed operations.

The driver is located in ``qcodes/instrument_drivers/cryomagnetics/cryomagnetics_4g.py``.

For more details and usage examples, please refer to the driver's documentation:
