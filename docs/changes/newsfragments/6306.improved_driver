The ``qcodes.instrument_drivers.american_magnetics.AMIModel430`` driver can now be snapshotted with the heater missing or not enabled
without triggering warnings. Furthermore confusing aliases for parameters on the switch module have been deprecated since use of these would
lead to incorrect state of the parameters.
The aliases ``qcodes.instrument_drivers.american_magnetics.AMI_430_visa.AMI430_3D`` and ``qcodes.instrument_drivers.american_magnetics.AMI_430_visa.AMI430``
have been deprecated.
