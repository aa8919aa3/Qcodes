The QCoDeS Measurement Context manager, DataSaverBuilder and DoND functions have been instrumented as OpenTelemetry traces.
This enables users to correlate log messages with the the measurement that they were performed within.
See the (OpenTelemetry)[https://opentelemetry.io/] documentation for examples of how this can be used.

The log exporting using OpenCensus within QCoDeS is expected to be deprecated and eventually removed in line
with OpenCensus being discontinued. Users that are interested in gathering telemetry of their setups are encouraged
to provide their own solution based on OpenTelemetry.
