Parameters controlling the pid-values, pumps and state of the temperature channels have been added to OxfordTriton. 
This allows temperature sweeps from base temperature to several Kelvin to be fully automatic. Code to create such sweeps can be found at https://github.com/qdev-dk/MeasFunc/blob/main/measfunc/temperature_sweep.py.
