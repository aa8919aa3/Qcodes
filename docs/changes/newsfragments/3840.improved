``InstrumentChannel`` now subclasses a new class ``InstrumentModule`` to clarify that instrument modules may
serve other purposes than being channels. At the moment ``InstrumentModule`` and ``InstrumentChannel`` are identical.
The type hints have been updated to clarify that only subclasses of ``InstrumentModule`` and ``ChannelLists``
are allowed submodules.
