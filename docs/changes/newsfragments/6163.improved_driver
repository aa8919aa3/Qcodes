The SignalHound, SRS, Stahl, Weinschel and Yokogawa drivers shipping with QCoDeS
have been updated to ensure all Parameters are set as static
attributes that are documented and can be type checked. The docs for the same drivers have been
updated to not document inherited members. This makes the documentation significantly more readable
as it focuses on specific members for a given instrument. The documentation now also links superclasses.
Please consult these for inherited members.
