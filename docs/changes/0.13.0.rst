Changelog for QCoDeS 0.13.0 (Not released yet)
==============================================

The April 2020 release of QCoDeS (Not released yet)

Breaking Changes:
_________________

The dictionary ``station.components['config']`` representing a Station
configuration loaded from a YAML file has been moved to ``station.config``.
The same change is reflected in the snapshot and the config can now
be accessed via ``station_snapshot['config']``. (#1913)

The ``QCoDeS`` configuration module has moved from ``qcodes.config`` to ``qcodes.configuration``
to disambiguate it from the current active config which is defined in ``qcodes.config`` as always (#1682)

The legacy api such as Loop, active_loop, active_data_set, Measure, DataSet, new_data, load_data, Task, Wait, BreakIf, FormatLocation, DataArray, Formatter, GNUPlotFormat, HDF5Format, DiskIO, are no more imported in ``QCoDeS`` namespace by default. The core config now contains a new flag `import_legacy_api` that can be set to True if the legacy api needs to be imported in the ``QCoDeS`` namespace. (#1962)
