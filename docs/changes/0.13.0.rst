Changelog for QCoDeS 0.13.0 (Not released yet)

Breaking Changes:
_________________

The dictionary ``station.components['config']`` representing a Station
configuration loaded from a YAML file has been moved to ``station.config``.
The same change is reflected in the snapshot and the config can now
be accessed via ``station_snapshot['config']``. (#1913)

The ``QCoDeS`` configuration module has moved from ``qcodes.config`` to ``qcodes.configuration``
to disambiguate it from the current active config which is defined in ``qcodes.config`` as always (#1682)
