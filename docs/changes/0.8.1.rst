Changelog for QCoDeS 0.8.1
==========================

This is a bug fix release fixing the following issues

* QDac cache returns invalid data
* Station config validation raises exception if validation failed

The QDac driver received a thorough overhauling of the `vrange` and `v` parameters. `read_state` has been deprecated.
The Station validation logs the full config file on validation warnings. There has been a bug which caused an exception,
when creating the log message if the station config is read from a file.
