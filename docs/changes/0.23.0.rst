Changelog for QCoDeS 0.23.0
===========================

The February 2021 release of QCoDeS.

---------
Improved:
---------

- Add ``pandas`` and ``xarray`` methods to ``DataSetCache``  matching the ``DataSet`` (#2763)
- Fix to Avoid loading data twice in dataset's ``to_xarray_dataset`` method (#2762)
- Fix for the ``to_pandas`` method on a live dataset by not loading from disk (#2761)
- Add optional ``tqdm`` progress bar to ``doNd`` functions (#2734)
- Improvment to ``Station`` by adding the ``load_all_instruments`` method to load everything specified
  in configuration yaml (#2721)
- In ``guid_helpers`` the regular expression used to read guids from a string represantation of a
  list/tuple of guids was flawed. Improvment to use ``ast.parse`` makes it a lot easier and error proof. (#2700)

-----------------
Improved drivers:
-----------------

- Feature to determine the frequency and power parameter validators on the Agilent ``E8527D`` microwave

Under the hood:
---------------

- Simplify science requirements tests (#2768)
